# Pocket Code manual

Pocket Code puts your Claude Code and Codex conversations in a browser and on your phone, running on
your own server. This manual explains each feature: what it does, how to turn it on, how to use it,
how it works underneath and what to do when it misbehaves. It is written for the person using Pocket
and for the AI agents working beside them, and both read the same pages.

New here? Start with [Getting started](getting-started.md).

A *conversation* is one Claude Code or Codex session that Pocket runs for you; the app and this manual
say conversation.

[SECURITY.md](../../SECURITY.md) explains the security model and how to report a problem.

## For agents reading this

Pocket tells every agent it starts where this index is. When the user asks how something in Pocket works or
how to set it up, open the page for that feature from the table above and answer from it; don't read
the source unless the page doesn't cover the question. Each page's **For agents** section lists the
commands you can run and the rules for when to act and when to ask. The comment at the top of each page
names the release it was last checked against (`checked:`). If the user's Pocket is much newer than that
and the page seems wrong, say so and check the code.

## Keeping it current

Each page opens with a comment naming the release it was checked against and the source files it
describes. `npm run check:manual` lists the pages whose sources changed after the page did; see
[CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md#the-manual) for how pages are kept in step with releases.
