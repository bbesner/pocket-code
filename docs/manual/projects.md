# Projects

Projects keep a card for each piece of work you want to come back to: where you left off, the next step, what it is waiting for, a checklist of remaining steps, reminders, notes and the conversations that worked on it. You track a project when you decide to, from Pocket Code or by asking an agent; nothing becomes a project on its own. Agents keep the card current with the `pocket-board` command.

## Turn it on

Projects is off until you switch it on for the whole instance:

1. Open **Settings → Projects, files, tasks & vault**.
2. Turn on **Projects**.

The switch applies to every device and to agent conversations. While it is on, Pocket installs the `pocket-projects` skill for Claude Code and Codex and tells the agents it runs how to track a project (see [For agents](#for-agents)). Turning it off hides Projects, refuses the `pocket-board` command and stops reminders from being announced; the cards stay on disk and come back when you turn it on again.

In Assistant mode the **Projects, files, tasks & vault** group is not shown in Settings. Switch to **Developer mode** under **Settings → Appearance → Mode** to change it.

**Open projects** in the same Settings group (this device only) chooses how a project opens when you click it: **As a tab, like a conversation**, **Beside the conversation**, or **In a new browser window**.

## Use it

### Find your projects

- On a computer, the rail's switch has a **Projects** segment. It lists the active and waiting projects, with **Track**, **All**, and a **Scheduled** chip (or **Reminders** when Tasks is on).
- On a phone, the conversation list has a **Projects** chip.
- The Projects list groups cards into **Active**, **Waiting** and **Done** (Done is collapsed). Within a group, projects with due reminders come first, then the most recently updated.

Each row shows the next step (or the summary, or what it is waiting for), how many reminders are due or when the next one is, the number of open steps, and the live state mark of each linked conversation, as on its tab.

### Track a project

From the Projects list, click **Track a project**. From a conversation, click the **Add project** chip in the row above the message box, or choose **Add project** in the conversation's options. The **Project for this conversation** sheet offers:

- **Track a new project**: a card around this conversation. Its workspace becomes the project's directory, and the conversation is linked to the card.
- Any open project the conversation is not linked to yet: links the conversation to it.

The **Track a project** form has **Name** (required), **Where we left off**, **Next step**, **Directory** and **Link**. The directory must be a full path; agents working in that directory, or any folder inside it, find this card automatically. The link must be a full `http` or `https` address, for a plan or document kept elsewhere.

Once a conversation is linked, its chip shows the project's name and opens the card.

### What a card holds

| Part | What it is |
|---|---|
| Status | **Active**, **Waiting** or **Done**. |
| Updated · Verified | When the card last changed, and when its content (name, summary, next step, status, steps) last changed. Notes, reminders and linked conversations change Updated but not Verified. |
| Where we left off | The summary, up to 600 characters. |
| Next | The single next step, up to 600 characters. |
| Waiting for | Who or what the project waits on. Shown when set or when the project is Waiting. |
| Directory, Link | The project's folder on the server and an outside link. |
| Steps | The checklist of remaining steps, with "n of m done". |
| Reminders | Open reminders for the project or for one step. |
| Conversations | The conversations linked to the project, each with its live state. |
| Files | Files linked to the project, when [Files](files.md) is on (up to eight, then **All n files**). |
| Note | A field to add a note: a decision or reference worth keeping. |
| History | Every change, newest first, marked as made by you, an agent or an import. |

The buttons at the bottom are **Start conversation**, **Edit**, **Remind me** and **Finish project**, or **Resume project** on a finished one. The **⋯** button in the card's header opens **Project options**, which also has **Mark waiting** or **Mark active**, **Open beside** and **Open in a new window**.

### Keep the steps current

- Type in **Add a remaining step** and press **Add**. A step holds up to 300 characters; a project holds up to 200 steps.
- Tick a step to mark it done; untick it to reopen it. Finishing a step stops its reminder.
- The **⋯** on a step offers **Remind me about this step** and **Edit the text**. Steps cannot be deleted; they stay in the card and its history.

### Waiting and finished projects

- **Mark waiting** sets the status to Waiting. Say who or what it waits for with **Edit** → **Waiting for**. **Mark active** sets it back.
- **Finish project** asks once, then moves the card to Done and cancels its open reminders. Unchecked steps stay on the card.
- **Resume project** brings a finished card back to Active. Its old reminders do not come back; set new ones if you need them.

A finished project accepts edits, notes and conversation links, but not new steps, step changes or reminders until you resume it.

### Set a reminder

Click **Remind me** on the card (or in its options), or **Remind me about this step** on a step. Pick one of:

- **Tomorrow morning**, **In three days**, **Next Monday** or **In a week**, each at 9:00 in this device's time zone.
- **Another time**: any date and time. A time more than a minute in the past is refused.

**Says** is the reminder's text. It defaults to "Revisit *project name*", or to the step's text for a step reminder.

A project has at most one open reminder of its own, and each step at most one. Setting a new one replaces the open one; that is how **Remind later** works. A due reminder stays on the card, marked **Due**, until you **Dismiss** it or set a new time. On a Waiting project, a due reminder also offers **Resume project**.

### How reminders reach you

When a reminder comes due, Pocket announces it once:

- **Push** to every device that has **Settings → Notifications & voice → Push to this device** on with **Due tasks and reminders** selected. The notification reads "Reminder: *project name*" with the reminder's text. Tapping it opens the card; its **Tomorrow** button moves the reminder to 9:00 the next day in that device's time zone without opening Pocket.
- **Email**, when the server has email set up and **Email due tasks and reminders to** has an address (same Settings group).
- **The server's reminder hook**, when the operator set `POCKET_REMINDER_HOOK`.

With **Notice a day before** on (same Settings group, for the whole instance), a second notice, "Reminder tomorrow: *project name*", goes out 24 hours ahead. A reminder set less than a day ahead gets only the due announcement.

The due count shows on the Projects segment and chip, on the card's tab, and on the installed app's icon. When [Tasks](tasks.md) is on, Tasks carries the count instead, and open reminders are listed among your tasks.

Pocket keeps reminders itself. It does not create calendar events or cron jobs.

### The Scheduled view

**Scheduled** lists every open reminder across your projects, earliest first, with the due ones marked. Open it with the **Scheduled** chip on the Projects list or in the rail, or at `#/projects/scheduled`. When Tasks is on, the chip reads **Reminders** and opens the Tasks list, which shows the same reminders among your tasks; `#/projects/scheduled` still opens Scheduled.

A reminder's **⋯** offers **Open project**, **Remind later** and **Dismiss**.

### Start a conversation from a project

**Start conversation** on the card (or **Start a conversation** in its options) opens a new conversation:

- in the project's directory, when it has one;
- with the agent (Claude or Codex) that last worked on the project;
- with a briefing already written as the first message: where you left off, the next step, what it is waiting for, up to 20 open steps with their ids, the last three notes, open reminders, the link, the last three linked conversations, and the `pocket-board` commands to keep the card current.

Edit the briefing if you like, then send it. The conversation is linked to the project as it starts. The project's chip above the message shows which project it will join; click it and choose **Remove the link** to start without the project.

### Linked conversations

The **⋯** on a linked conversation offers **Open conversation**, **Open beside** and **Unlink from this project**. Unlinking leaves the conversation and its history untouched. A project links up to 50 conversations.

## How it works

- **Data.** Every project lives in `projects.json` in `POCKET_DATA_DIR`, which defaults to the Pocket Code directory. Pocket writes it atomically, mode `0600`. Edit cards only through Pocket or `pocket-board`; Pocket keeps the file in memory and overwrites hand edits.
- **One writer.** The UI and `pocket-board` both go through the server. A change from the UI carries the card's revision; if the card changed since you loaded it, the change is refused and the current card is shown.
- **Project ids** come from the name: lowercase letters and digits joined by hyphens, up to 60 characters, with `-2`, `-3` added when the id is taken. Step and reminder ids are 12-character hex strings.
- **Directory matching.** `pocket-board` finds "this directory's project" by looking for the project whose directory is the current directory or contains it. The deepest match wins. Finished projects never match.
- **Refreshing.** An open list or card refreshes when the window regains focus, when a reply ends in any Pocket window on the device, and every 30 seconds while it is open, so a card an agent changes updates on its own.
- **Reminder checks.** The server checks for due reminders every minute and a few seconds after it starts. Each reminder is marked as announced before it is sent, so a crash mid-send never announces it twice; a failed push, email or hook is logged and not retried.

### Limits

| Limit | Value |
|---|---|
| Projects | 200 |
| Name | 120 characters |
| Summary, next step, waiting for, note, reminder text | 600 characters |
| Step | 300 characters; 200 steps per project |
| Linked conversations | 50 per project |
| Reminders kept | Every open one; past 50 in total, only the last 10 settled ones are kept |
| History | The last 200 entries |
| Directory, link | 1,024 characters |

### Settings and environment

| Setting or variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| **Settings → Projects, files, tasks & vault → Projects** | Turns the feature on for the instance (`projects` in `pocket-settings.json`). |
| **Open projects** (same group, this device) | Tab, beside the conversation, or a new window. |
| **Settings → Notifications & voice → Notice a day before** | A second notice 24 hours before each reminder. |
| **Email due tasks and reminders to** (same group) | The address for reminder email. Needs `POCKET_SMTP_URL`. |
| `POCKET_REMINDER_HOOK` | A shell command run for each due reminder, with the reminder as JSON on standard input. It runs without Pocket's own secrets in its environment. See [operations](../operations.md#optional-libraries-projects-files-tasks-inbox-and-the-vault) for the payload. |
| `POCKET_REMINDER_HOOK_TIMEOUT_MS` | How long one hook run may take before Pocket stops it and everything it started. Default 60000. |
| `POCKET_TZ` | The time zone for reminder times given to `pocket-board` without an offset. Default: the server's own zone. |
| `POCKET_REMINDER_CHECK_MS` | How often due reminders are checked, in milliseconds. Default 60000. |
| `POCKET_SKILLS=0` | Stops Pocket installing its skills into the agents' skill folders. |

## For agents

### When to track a project

Create a project **only when the user asks**: "track this", "make this a project", "add this to my projects", "keep track of this work", or the **Track a project** / **Add project** buttons. Never track a project because a session started, work is unfinished or a blocker came up. At a natural stopping point you may offer once and wait for the answer.

While Projects is on, every conversation Pocket runs gets this instruction, with the install's real command path and the conversation's id filled in:

> This Pocket Code tracks projects. Only when the user asks to track this work, make it a project, or add it to one, use the pocket-board command; the pocket-projects skill has the full procedure, which questions to ask and when to set reminders. Check `status --all` first and link this session to a matching project (`link-session <this session id> -p <project-id>`) rather than duplicating it; otherwise run `track --requested --name "<name>" --session <id> --summary … --next …` from the working directory. Ask at most one question, and set a reminder (`remind --at`) only when the user asks or agrees to a time. When a tracked project's work reaches a stopping point, keep its card current with `update --summary … --next …`, `task add|done` and `note`. Never track a project the user did not ask for.

The full procedure, including which single question to ask and how to word names, summaries and steps, is in the [pocket-projects skill](../../skills/pocket-projects/SKILL.md). While Projects is on, Pocket installs it into `~/.claude/skills/pocket-projects` and, when Codex is installed, `$CODEX_HOME/skills/pocket-projects` (default `~/.codex`), with the exact command for this server. It never overwrites a folder of the same name that it did not create, and removes its own copy when Projects is turned off.

A conversation started with **Start conversation** is already linked; its first message names the project id and the open step ids. Pick up from the next step and do not link or track again.

Finishing a project is not approval to deploy, spend money or contact anyone.

### Running the command

Run `node scripts/pocket-board.mjs` from the Pocket Code directory (the installed skill names the full path). It talks to the running server over loopback with the token the server writes to `<data dir>/cli-token` at every start; it never opens `projects.json`. It reads `POCKET_DATA_DIR`, `PORT`, `POCKET_URL` and `POCKET_TZ` from the environment or from the `.env` in the Pocket Code directory (`POCKET_ENV_FILE` names another). The server's address comes from `POCKET_URL`, else `<data dir>/cli-url`, else `PORT`, else `http://127.0.0.1:3610`.

Most commands act on the project whose directory contains the current directory. Add `-p <id>` (or `--project <id>`) to name another.

Times are printed in the user's time zone (the one their browser reports to Pocket, else `POCKET_TZ`, else the server's), with the zone named. A time you pass without an offset is read in `POCKET_TZ`, or the server's zone when it is unset. If the user's zone differs from that, pass an explicit offset (`2026-11-06T09:00-05:00`).

### Command reference

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `track --requested --name "…" [--summary "…"] [--next "…"] [--dir <path>] [--link <url>] [--session <id>]` | Creates a card. `--requested` says the user asked and is required. The directory defaults to the current directory; `--dir` must be a full path. `--session` links the conversation (a Claude session id, or `cx:<id>` for Codex). |
| `status` | The current directory's card. With no match, lists every project and says none contains this directory. |
| `status --all` | One line per project: status, id, name, due reminders, open steps. |
| `status -p <id>` | That project's card. |
| `update [--name "…"] [--summary "…"] [--next "…"] [--waiting-for "…"] [--link <url>] [--dir <path>] [--status active\|waiting\|done]` | Changes the named fields. At least one is required. `--status done` finishes the project and cancels its reminders. |
| `task add "text"` | Adds a step. |
| `task done <step-id>` / `task reopen <step-id>` | Ticks or unticks a step. Done stops the step's reminder. |
| `task edit <step-id> --text "…"` | Rewrites a step. |
| `remind --at "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM" [--task <step-id>] [--text "…"]` | Sets the project's reminder, or a step's with `--task`, replacing the open one. Seconds and an offset (`Z`, `+02:00`) are accepted. A time in the past is accepted and comes due at the next check. |
| `dismiss <reminder-id>` | Cancels an open reminder. |
| `note "text"` | Adds a note to the history. |
| `link-session <id>` / `unlink-session <id>` | Links or unlinks a conversation. |
| `scheduled` | Every open reminder across projects, earliest first, due ones marked `DUE`. |
| `context [--hook]` | A short briefing on the current directory's unfinished project, for a session start. Prints nothing and exits 0 when there is no project, Projects is off or Pocket is down. `--hook` prints it as Claude Code SessionStart hook JSON. |
| `import <snapshot.json>` | One-time import of a board snapshot (version 2 JSON) from the older Mission Control board. Projects whose ids already exist are skipped. |
| `help` | The usage summary. |

Add `--json` to `status`, `scheduled` and any command that changes a card to get JSON instead of text.

To brief Claude Code sessions on the directory's project at start, add a SessionStart hook to `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [
      { "hooks": [ { "type": "command", "command": "node ~/pocket-code/scripts/pocket-board.mjs context --hook" } ] }
    ]
  }
}
```

Replace `~/pocket-code` with the Pocket Code directory.

### Examples

Here `pocket-board` stands for `node scripts/pocket-board.mjs`.

```bash
pocket-board status --all
pocket-board track --requested --name "Acme HOA camera upgrade" \
  --summary "Quote approved; parts ordered." --next "Schedule the install with the board" \
  --session 3f2a9c1e-5b7d-4e8f-9a0b-1c2d3e4f5a6b
pocket-board task add "Confirm the pole mounts fit"
pocket-board update --status waiting --waiting-for "Parts delivery"
pocket-board remind --at "2026-11-06T09:00" --text "Check the parts delivery"
pocket-board update -p acme-hoa-camera-upgrade --summary "Installed and tested." --next "Send the handover notes"
```

### Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | Done. |
| 1 | Any other error; the message says what. |
| 2 | The project is finished; resume it first. The current card is printed. |
| 3 | Projects is off. Tell the user to turn it on under **Settings → Projects, files, tasks & vault → Projects**; do not keep the project anywhere else. |
| 4 | The token was refused. |
| 5 | No tracked project contains the current directory, or no project has that id. |
| 6 | `track` was run without `--requested`. |

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `No CLI token at …` | Pocket is not running, or the command is reading a different data directory. | Start Pocket. Run the command from the same Pocket Code directory, or set `POCKET_DATA_DIR` to the server's. |
| `Pocket Code is not reachable at …` | The server is down or not answering (the command waits 30 seconds). | Check that Pocket is running; set `POCKET_URL` if it listens elsewhere. |
| Exit 4, `unauthorized` | The token belongs to another install, or the request did not come straight over loopback (through a proxy or tunnel). | Run the command on the server itself, against the Pocket whose data directory holds the token. |
| `No tracked project contains …` | The current directory is outside every active project's directory. | Pass `-p <id>` (ids are in `status --all`), or set the project's directory with `update --dir`. |
| `The directory must be a full path.` | `--dir` was relative. | Pass an absolute path. |
| `This project is finished. Resume it first.` | Steps and reminders cannot change on a Done project. | `update --status active`, or **Resume project** on the card. |
| A reminder arrives hours off | The time was given without an offset and the server's zone (`POCKET_TZ` or the system zone) is not the user's. | Pass an offset, or set `POCKET_TZ` to the user's zone. |
| No reminder on any channel | Projects is off; reminders are announced only while it is on. | Turn on **Settings → Projects, files, tasks & vault → Projects**. |
| No push for a due reminder | Push is not set up on the server, the device is not subscribed, or **Due tasks and reminders** is off for that device. | Check **Settings → Notifications & voice** on the device. The card still shows the reminder as due. |
| No reminder email | `POCKET_SMTP_URL` is not set, or no address is saved. | Set it up (see [Settings](settings.md#notifications--voice)) and use **Send a test** in **Settings → Notifications & voice**. |
| A push, email or hook run failed once and never came | Each reminder is announced once; a failed send is logged, not retried. | Check the server log; the card still shows the reminder as **Due**. |
| "This project changed since you loaded it" | The card changed on another device or by an agent. | Review the current card, which is now shown, and make the change again. |
